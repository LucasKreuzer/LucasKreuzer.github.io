                    <h1>Hello friends!</h1>
                    <p> My name is Lucas Kreuzer, and I am always curious about new things. 
                        No matter how small, large, near or far away they are. 
                        That’s probably the reason, why I am a scientist. 
                        You never know, what new thing is hiding just around the corner.

                    <p> I am an experimental physicist with a chemical background, 
                        who investigates polymeric and metallic materials with neutron and x-ray scattering. 
                        Currently, I study the dynamics and structures of liquid metal alloys in micro-gravity environment, 
                        and how this can be used to develop specialized metal alloys for industry, aero- and space applications. </p>
                    <p> I created this website to share my research and other science news with you. 
                        From time to time, I would also like to talk about my experience as a scientist, 
                        and what advantages and disadvantages this brings along. 
                        Hopefully, this collection of new (and sometimes old) science and semi-randomly selected PhD and postdoc experiences help you, 
                        as much as they help me, to orientate in an always evolving and fascinating academic wonderland.</p>
