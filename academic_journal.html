                           He had a graph with viscosity data that span over 17 (!) orders of magnitude!<br><br></p>

                        <p>But what does this actual mean? And what actually is viscosity, with this weird unit (Pa s)? 
                           I tried to give a comprehensive answere here.</p>

                        <p>Today I was once again thinking about not releasing this website. 
                           It's not professional enough, it's not interesting enough, who cares about my research anyway, 
                           why bother with all this html coding, and in the end you might even have to pay money for hosting your webpage...<br><br></p>

                        <p>Well, since you are reading this, it's obvious that I did launch this webpage. Sometimes ideas have to be realized. 
                           They have to leave your imagination and enter existance. My webpage, my party. I like it. It's fun. 
                           If you like it as well, be my guest. If you don't like it, I hope you find whatever party you are looking for somewhere else ‚úåüèΩ </p>

                        <p>Oh wow, I just had a meeting with my former PhD supervisor about a potential scientific future and now I am super excited about ALL the possibilities out there. <br><br>
                           I am such a priviledged, happy, and now even more motivated scientist. That reminds me once again how important it is to have motivating and encouraging people around you.</p>
                            
                        <p>Definitely something I want to be for others, doesn't matter if in academia or not. How are you feeling about this?<br><br></p>

                        <p>And I finally finished the code for this academic diary. From now on everything will be live &#128517</p>

                        <p>Happy new year, everyone! I am back in the office and already started my ambitious academic resolution:</p>
                        <p>One paper a day (keeps the imposter away?! Or maybe not, we'll see).<br><br><br>
                        
                        Anyhow, last year, whenever I started to read a paper, I ended up thinking:</p>
                        <p>'Why are you wasting your time, reading this paper, which is (at best) marginally related to your stuff! You should better write or measure someting'<br><br><br>
                        And of course, whenever I wrote or measured something I thought: 'Damn, you know nothing! You better read some papers, man'<br><br><br>
                            
                        For this year, I decided to not think about this anymore. I will read one paper (or 45 min if it's a long one) first thing in the morning. Cannot hurt, right?!</p>
