                        <p>I am back in the DLR labs to do some more levitation experiments. We have a pretty good idea about the strucutre-dynamics relationship in the binary CuTi system. Now it's time to look at the properties of ternary CuTi-Si and CuTi-Al systems.<br><br></p>
                        <p>It's fascinating how only a few at% of Si or Al can change the macroscopic behavior of an alloy. Since its so little Si or Al, we don't think it's a topological or packing, but a chemical phenomenon based on attractive/repulsive interactions of the minor additive (Si/Al) to Cu and Ti.</p>
                        <p>With these studies, we aim for improving algorithms of molecular dynamics simulations, which require reliable (that's why we levitate the samples) experimental data as input. So far, only few ternary CuTi-based alloys were investigated. Probably because perfoming experiments with these alloys are everything but trivial. To quote my colleague: All easy systems are already measured. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </p>

                           why bother with all this html coding, and in the end you might even have to pay money for hosting your webpage...<br><br></p>

                        <p>Well, since you are reading this, it's obvious that I did launch this webpage. Sometimes ideas have to be realized. 
                           They have to leave your imagination and enter existance. My webpage, my party. I like it. It's fun. 
                           If you like it as well, be my guest. If you don't like it, I hope you find whatever party you are looking for somewhere else ‚úåüèΩ </p>

                        <p>Happy new year, everyone! I am back in the office and already started my ambitious academic resolution:</p>
                        <p>One paper a day (keeps the imposter away?! Or maybe not, we'll see).<br><br><br>
                        
                        Anyhow, last year, whenever I started to read a paper, I ended up thinking:</p>
                        <p>'Why are you wasting your time, reading this paper, which is (at best) marginally related to your stuff! You should better write or measure someting'<br><br><br>
                        And of course, whenever I wrote or measured something I thought: 'Damn, you know nothing! You better read some papers, man'<br><br><br>
                            
                        For this year, I decided to not think about this anymore. I will read one paper (or 45 min if it's a long one) first thing in the morning. Cannot hurt, right?!</p>
