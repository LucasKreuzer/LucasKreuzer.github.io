<p> <br><br>
    Here is a story of a beagle<br>
    Came short and stumped and true<br>
    Little did he know of life<br>
    And little did he do<br><br>
</p>
<p>
    He was a laboratory specimen<br>
    Once upon a time<br>
    Though he forgot most of it somehow<br>
    Almost all the time<br><br>
</p>
<p>
    There was a catch to it though<br>
    Something sad and forlorn<br>
    He could never look anyone in the eye<br> 
    For reasons I do not know<br><br>
</p>
<p>
    We thought it was too much shampoo<br>
    Tried and tested on him<br>
    And he’d lost some faith in mankind<br>
    Maybe that’s where we came in<br><br>
</p>
<p>
    We picked him up and scrubbed him<br>
    From the shivers he’d picked up<br>
    Teaching him how to be a dog<br>
    And run and play and hop<br><br>
</p>
    There was something in his eye<br>
    Something you would notice<br>
    A spark you just couldn’t ignite<br>
    With all the tools of mankind<br><br>
<p>
    He grew warmer by the minute<br>
    Looking for more cuddles everyday<br>
    And soon for even a few seconds<br>
    He couldn’t stand being away<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes if you close your eyes<br>
    You may just see him hop<br>
    Almost like a goat kid<br>
    Dancing for reasons naught<br><br>
</p> 

<p>
    Now, I promised I’d write this poem<br>
    Just before he left<br>
    But I hadn’t the strength nor the chance<br>
    To get him out of bed<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    So, I can just say this:<br><br>
</p>


<p>
    He was a merry dog<br>
    In a merry life<br>
    But all I remember of the end is<br>
    He looked me in the eye<br>
    And said a thousand words.<br><br>
