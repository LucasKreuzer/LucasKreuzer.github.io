<p><br><br>
    They have killed the tree<br />
    My gentle friend’s heart is stirred<br />
    They have razed the roots<br />
    And replaced the space and life of organisms<br />
    With energy-efficient lighting and electric cars<br />
    The tree must have had a patient relationship<br />
    Shared many wisps of thoughts with my dear friend<br />
    He who flutters like a little bird<br />
    He who stares at you like a bee<br />
    His rapid heart beating<br />
    As he stares outta the window<br />
    Through the boughs and branches and flowers and the whirls in the breeze,<br />
    He encounters the 'Egg', a reactor, atop which crows perch<br />
    Crows remember faces<br />
    Elephants remember kindness<br />
    Birds sing stories<br />
    Trees write them in their bones<br />
    Earth stratifies deeds<br />
    Kindness is a tsunami<br />
    One of cosmic magnitude<br />
    Redistributing the sum total of its waves<br />
    Kindness imbues power<br />
    Imagination, secrets<br />
    Indistinguishable from magic<br />
    He stares at his notebook<br />
    Rolls a cigarette<br />
    Stares at you and says something out of the TUMblue<br />
    He purses his lips onto a cushion and inhales a mixture which he holds in with a thought<br />
    As the nicotine kicks into his bloodstream<br />
    He exhales the smoke<br />
    And runs his fingers through his hair<br />
    Picks up an instrument<br />
    And sings his heart out<br />
    And laughs with a glint in his eye<br />
    They have killed the tree<br />
    But not the earth’s ability<br />
    To move a little seed<br />
    And convert it to life<br />
    With the help of warmth and water, light and air<br />
    Life begets life<br />
    Light begets light<br />
    You need a thought<br />
    You need understanding<br />
    You need to love to be loved<br />
    You need to set love free and choose you<br />
    Love is a shy plant,<br />
    With powers old and sacred<br />
    Entrusted with a single condition<br />
    Put it to good use, share freely the fruits of your deed<br />
    For then it grows, multiplies and wins over all<br />
    Through love and laughter, harmony and knowledge<br />
    Extend through tendrils of understanding, trust and amnesty<br />
    Extending the elixir to undo the past<br />
    And grow larger than before, equal and connected<br />
    Look, do you see where the core of this energy-efficiency lies?</p>
