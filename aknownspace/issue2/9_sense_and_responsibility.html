    “Hi, so what do you do?”<br />
    --------------------------------<br />
    Pretty straightforward question. Hm, what do I do?<br />
    “Hello, I am a PhD student, at the Physics Department.”<br />
    At this point, many people who are no scientists, give me the default “oh you poor soul, why” – look. A few scientists do, too.<br />
    “PhD? In Physics?”<br />
    “It’s actually quite fun.”<br />
    Usually this doesn’t help my case with the other party.<br />
    At this point - not just on one occasion - I have felt the urge to snap my fingers in their face and go<br />
    “Hey, I am not insane –“<br />
    and (while flailing my arms around) shout<br />
    “It’s a real job, I swear!11!!”<br />
    (Note to self: I should really do that sometime.)<br />
    But you know…<br />
    …instead, in a standard conversation, I start describing my research field, how I am trying to answer my research question…<br />
    …while inevitably watching a deepening frown on the other party’s face.<br />
    --------------------------------<br />
    If only they knew how right they are.<br />
    My research either is bordering or inside the “completely irrelevant” category, depending on what kind of day we’re having.<br />
    “Hmh.” – said everyone.<br />
    Don’t get me wrong – for the record, I think the methodology is nerdy, the instruments are cool and the community is both. I got lucky and I mean it when I say: “It’s actually quite fun”. But – these things don’t change the fact that my research question is super niche and has been created by a small community for a small community.<br />
    Whatever information I discover and will publish as PhD student will probably be there for the hell of it.<br />
    Stating anything else – is delusional – if I may say so myself.<br />
    --------------------------------<br />
    Before I go on, I feel like there are two things I need to clarify:<br />
    What makes this research possible – bottom line – is reverse engineering a research question to a rare methodology – for better or for worse.<br />
    What keeps me going despite this rather bleak view of things is – bottom line – my opinion getting what a PhD degree is about. To teach the person that does it anything but what their random research topic is about.<br />
    “It’s a real job, I swear!11!!”<br />
    (Note to self: never say that, ever, because it isn’t.)<br />
    “But wouldn’t you agree it’s irresponsible pouring public funds into a project that makes no significant contribution to humanity?”<br />
    No wonder people frown. If only they knew how right they are.<br />
    Can’t blame anyone, since<br />
    – as of today, anyway –<br />
    “I’m doing my PhD for the hell of it.”<br />
    “Come on, you don’t make any sense, there must be a reason you do what you do.”<br />
    --------------------------------<br />
    “Hi, so what do you do?”<br />
    <br />
    Time to change my answer.<br />
    “Hello, I am training to be a good scientist.”<br />
    --------------------------------<br />
    “What I do” is not a job, it’s a collective investment.<br />
    “Hello, I am a scientist. We are many, we work together and together we can do great stuff.”<br />
    <br />
    I owe you one. Big time.<br />
    Yours truly.</p>
