             <p> After a more specific topic, we decided to go again for a more vague and unseizable theme, which was set to ‚Chasing truths‘ <p> 
             <p> Since the number and diversity of contributors become larger and richer, we are excited to see, 
                 ow the topic is interpreted by people with different social, cultural and scientific backgrounds.</p>

                  <p>Lower than me, always lower than me – I turn my eyes down to see it; I have to, for it is always down there on the ground as one of the features of the ground, one of its variants – 
                    fresh, shiny, transparent and amorphous, its only defect is that it is not weightless. Lower, always lower, this vice it satisfies with obstinacy and by all means available: undermining, 
                    corroding, permeating, and filtering through. This vice that works its way from the inside out, does not only affect the surroundings, but erodes the element itself – 
                    and while reaching for a new low, it humbly grovels on its belly like a monk of a mendicant order, or refusing to assume any form, disintegrates like a cadaver. Insane! 
                    For sure, we all obey the law of gravity. Take this armoire, how hard-headedly it would follow the same need, if it were not properly balanced: were it not nailed to the floor, then regardless of damage, 
                    I believe, it would rather throw itself to the ground; but to some extent it plays with gravity and defies it, for it doesn’t just disintegrate into a heap of wood, it resists and maintains its personality and form; 
                    whereas liquid by definition does not. So, the influence this vice has on water is without any measure, for it can render it rapid or stagnant, fierce or absolutely amorphous, amorphous and fierce, fierce and terebrating, 
                    cunning, undermining and filtering through to such a degree that we can do with it whatever we want, taking it through the pipes and making it shoot vertically, disintegrating into drops of rain. 
                    Oh, it makes a perfect slave!</p>

                  <p> But we call those forest walkers, who have become isolated and homeless by the great process and finally see themselves delivered to destruction. 
                    This could be the fate of many, even of all - so there must be added a destiny. This lies in the fact that the forest walker is determined to offer resistance and to fight the, perhaps hopeless, fight. 
                    Thus, the forest walker is the one who possesses an original relationship to freedom, which, seen temporally, expresses itself in the fact that he resists automatism, that he resists automatism and does not intend to draw its ethical consequence, fatalism.
