Liquid levitating metals - That are three words, where you might think 'Ok... and what are you now gonna do with that?!'
</p>

<p>Here in this section, I want to answer exactly this question (and hopefully all follow-up questions). I want to show you, why it is important to investigate liquid metals (meaning the metal melt), and how the structure of the melt is correlated with its dynamics (and why this is not always the case).
For the experiments, the samples have to be levitated. And sometimes, we measure them in µ-gravity conditions. Levitating things is fun, but also not trivial. And doing that in µ-gravity is a whole different story. In the following, I want to share with you, how that works, and why it is crucial for our measurements.
